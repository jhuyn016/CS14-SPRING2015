For example selection sort is unstable because if you have a list like 3, 3, 1 selection 
sort will swap the 3 and the 1 making it 1, 3, 3 so the first 3 needs to go before the 2nd 3 
but instead comes after which makes it unstable. But if you use a linked list and insert an element
instead of swapping selection is will be stable.
